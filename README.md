👋 Hey there! This C++ program is an exciting one! 
It takes input of 20 integers from the user and then counts the number of even, odd, and zero integers in that input. 🤔

👨‍💻 The program uses an integer array to store the 20 integers and then loops through the array to check each integer.
If the integer is a zero, it increments a counter for zeros. If the integer is even, it increments a counter for evens. 
If the integer is odd, it increments a counter for odds. 🤓

👀 Finally, the program prints out the count of even, odd, and zero integers. 
This program is perfect for anyone who wants to quickly analyze a set of data and determine how many of those data points meet certain criteria. 😎

👩‍💻 So, if you're a programmer, a math enthusiast, or just someone who loves to analyze data, give this program a try! 
It's easy to use and provides valuable insights. 🚀
